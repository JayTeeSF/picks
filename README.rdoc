The purpose of this app is to help me track and (eventually) analyze potential stock-picks.

And, although I like the thrill of trading, I enjoy my day job more. So I'm looking for some low-risk picks that
I can apply some dollar-cost averaging to. Moreover, I want stocks that hold their value and return significant
dividents (e.g. $0.25 on $22.00 dollars)


Thanks to The Street (i.e. http://www.thestreet.com/story/11429744/4/10-stocks-that-will-let-you-retire.html)
for helping me identify some of my initial picks.
